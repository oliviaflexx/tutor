                Iâ€™d like to help you tell the unique story of your talents and
                qualifications that will gain you admission to the US college or
                university of your choice. The application process is
                complicated. It is time consuming, and, likely, unfamiliar to
                families outside of the US. I can help you work through the
                process and meet crucial deadlines. I want you to be excited
                about the idea of studying in the US rather than anxious about
                getting in.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can also help you develop the English language skills expected
                in university, in particular if your education has not been in
                English. The preparation that I give you will help you to
                succeed not only in English classes but in your other courses as
                well.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a PhD in American literature and taught English in the US
                at the college level for over 25 years. In addition, I have two
                children who attended university in another country, so I
                understand how challenging the process can be.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a teacher, one of my strengths is building relationships with
                my students. I love working individually with students,
                supporting them to get to their goals and dreams. If college or
                university in the US is one of your dreams, contact me today so
                that we can turn that dream into a reality.
